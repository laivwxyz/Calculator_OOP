This Python program is a simple calculator that performs four basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user.
***The program also includes the concept of OOP*** and exception handling to capture errors during runtime.

## GETTING STARTED

### PREREQUISITES

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system.

### USAGE

1. Clone the repository or download the script `Calculator_OOP.py`, `calculator.py` `user_interface.py` and `inheritance_calculator.py`.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script.

4. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations by entering a corresponding number:

    - 1 for addition

    - 2 for subtraction

    - 3 for multiplication

    - 4 for division
    
    - 5 for modulus 
    
    - 6 for exponent
    
    - 7 for floor division

5. The application will ask the user for two numbers.

6. The program will perform the chosen mathematical operation on the two numbers and display the result.

7. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.

8. If the user chooses to try again, the program will repeat steps 4-7.

9. If the user chooses not to try again, the program will display `"Thank you!"` and exit.

## SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT

- When you run the script, it will prompt the user with the following:

- Assume that the user enters 1 to perform addition and the following numbers:

- The program will output the following:

- If the user enters 'y', the program will repeat the above steps. If the user enters `n`, the program will output:
